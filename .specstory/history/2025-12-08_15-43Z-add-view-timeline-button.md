_**User (2025-12-07 17:08Z)**_

In the build your timeline page, add a "View Timeline" button next to "Confirm Timeline" after atleast one row is added. The view timeline button should open a window below to show the timeline of the rows added so far. Use the attached image as reference to display the timeline when "View timeline" is clicked.
